### [Challenge Name: Ice Cream Parlor](/challenges/icecream-parlor)


Each time Sunny and Johnny take a trip to the Ice Cream Parlor, they pool together $m$ dollars for ice cream. On any given day, the parlor offers a line of $n$ flavors. Each flavor, $i$, is numbered sequentially with a unique ID number from $1$ to $n$ and has a cost, $c_i$, associated with it.

Given the value of $m$ and the cost of each flavor for $t$ trips to the Ice Cream Parlor, help Sunny and Johnny choose two flavors such that they spend their entire pool of money ($m$) during each visit. For each trip to the parlor, print the ID numbers for the two types of ice cream that Sunny and Johnny purchase as two space-separated integers on a new line. You must print the smaller ID first and the larger ID second.

**Note:** Two ice creams having unique IDs $i$ and $j$ *may* have the same cost (i.e., $c_i \equiv c_j$).
