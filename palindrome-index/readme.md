### [Challenge Name: Palindrome Index](/challenges/palindrome-index)


Given a string, $S$, of lowercase letters, determine the index of the character whose removal will make $S$ a palindrome. If $S$ is already a palindrome or no such character exists, then print $-1$. There will always be a valid solution, and any correct answer is acceptable. For example, if $S =$ *"bcbc"*, we can either remove *'b'* at index $0$ or *'c'* at index $3$.
