### [Challenge Name: Migratory Birds](/challenges/migratory-birds)


You have been asked to help study the population of birds migrating across the continent.  Each type of bird you are interested in will be identified by an integer value.  Each time a particular kind of bird is spotted, its id number will be added to your array of sightings.  You would like to be able to find out which type of bird is most common given a list of sightings.

Complete the $migratoryBirds$ function below to return the $id$ of the bird type most commonly sighted.  If two birds have equal numbers of sightings, return information for the bird type with the lower $id$.
