### [Challenge Name: Marc's Cakewalk](/challenges/marcs-cakewalk)


Marc loves cupcakes, but he also likes to stay fit. He eats $n$ cupcakes in one sitting, and each cupcake $i$ has a calorie count, $c_i$. After eating a cupcake with $c$ calories, he must walk *at least* $2^j \times c$ (where $j$ is the number cupcakes he has already eaten) miles to maintain his weight.

Given the individual calorie counts for each of the $n$ cupcakes, find and print a *long integer* denoting the minimum number of miles Marc must walk to maintain his weight. Note that he can eat the cupcakes *in any order*.
