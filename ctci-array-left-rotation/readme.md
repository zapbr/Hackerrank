### [Challenge Name: Arrays: Left Rotation](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/ctci-array-left-rotation)


A *left rotation* operation on an array of size $n$ shifts each of the array's elements $1$ unit to the left. For example, if $2$ left rotations are performed on array $[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]$, then the array would become $[3, 4, 5, 1, 2]$.

Given an array of $n$ integers and a number, $d$, perform $d$ left rotations on the array. Then print the updated array as a single line of space-separated integers.
