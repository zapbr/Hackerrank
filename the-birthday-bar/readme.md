### [Challenge Name: Birthday Chocolate](/challenges/the-birthday-bar)


Lily has a chocolate bar consisting of a row of $n$ squares where each square has an integer written on it. She wants to share it with Ron for his birthday, which falls on month $m$ and day $d$. Lily wants to give Ron a piece of chocolate only if it contains $m$ consecutive squares whose integers sum to $d$.

Given $m$, $d$, and the sequence of integers written on each square of Lily's chocolate bar, how many different ways can Lily break off a piece of chocolate to give to Ron?

For example, if $m=2$, $d=3$ and the chocolate bar contains $n$ squares with the integers $[1,2,1,3,2]$ written on them from left to right, the following diagram shows two ways to break off a piece:
