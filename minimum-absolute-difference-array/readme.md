### [Challenge Name: Minimum Absolute Difference in an Array](https://www.hackerrank.com/challenges/minimum-absolute-difference-in-an-array)


Consider an array of integers, $A = a_0, a_1, \ldots, a_{n-1}$. We define the [absolute difference](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_difference) between two elements, $a_i$ and $a_j$ (where $i \ne j$), to be the [absolute value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_value) of $a_i - a_j$.

Given an array of $n$ integers, find and print the minimum absolute difference between any two elements in the array.
